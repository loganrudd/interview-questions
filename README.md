# interview-questions
Answers to a series of interview problems


## Synopsis

This repo attempts to solve the following problems from the 
code-questions-python.pdf file found in the root of this repo:

1. Math - Write a function that takes two integers (x and y) and returns a list
   of numbers between x and y that are divisible by 5 but not by 7
2. O.O. - Write a generator that takes a number N and returns all perfect 
   squares less than N. Hint: use yield
   Example 1: N=30 then the generator will give 1, 4, 9, 16, 25 sequentially
3. Games - You have a chessboard with only the Rook on it. The Rook can move 
   up, down, left or right from your perspective. Write a function (or a class)
   that takes a series of movements and at the end of the sequence of movements 
   prints two numbers:
      a. The distance traveled by the Rook
      b. How far away the Rook is from its starting point
   Assume that the chessboard has no edges (the rook can travel any distance 
   in any direction). For example, if the Rook is moved in the following 
   sequence (up 1, left 3, down 2), then the Rook as traveled a distance of 6 
   spaces, and is 4 spaces away from its starting point.
4. File questions - Write a function that takes a phrase and a text file as 
   inputs. The function returns True if the phrase is found in the document and
   returns False otherwise. Note: Newline characters will not be included in 
   the phrase.


## Code Example

Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able 
to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code 
example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code 
is short and concise.

## Motivation

A short description of the motivation behind the creation and maintenance of 
the project. This should explain **why** the project exists.

## Installation

Provide code examples and explanations of how to get the project.

## API Reference

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the 
reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects 
it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

## Tests

Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.

## Contributors

Let people know how they can dive into the project, include important links to 
things like issue trackers, irc, twitter accounts if applicable.

## License

A short snippet describing the license (MIT, Apache, etc.)
